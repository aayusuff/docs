The [Sphinx documentation](https://acs.pages.rwth-aachen.de/public/simulation/dpsim/dpsim/sphinx/about.html) describes the Python API.

The [Doxygen documentation](https://acs.pages.rwth-aachen.de/public/simulation/dpsim/dpsim/doxygen/index.html) is automatically generated from the C++ code using Doxygen.
It is helpful to understand the general structure of the C++ DPsim core components.
